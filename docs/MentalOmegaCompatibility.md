# Mental Omega compatibility

This branch is the compatibility branch for a user-selected Mental Omega
profile. It uses the Yuri's Revenge simulation engine plus an explicit Ares
extension runtime identifier; vanilla `ra2` and `yr` profiles remain separate.

## Current foundation

- `mental-omega` is an explicit profile and is never inferred by the vanilla
  `detectGameProfile()` function.
- Android has a separate `mo` flavor and rejects a plain Yuri's Revenge folder
  unless Mental Omega rules/art and MO content are present.
- MO archive names such as `expandmo95.mix` are loaded through the profile-aware
  overlay path.
- VFS resolution has explicit layers and provenance diagnostics.
- The Ares scanner reports vanilla keys, known extension keys, and unknown
  extension keys separately.
- Additional armor types and per-armor warhead verses are normalized through a
  shared armor registry.
- Sides and countries are parsed from data-defined registries rather than
  assuming only the vanilla side/country set.
- Generic Ares prerequisites support custom groups, alternate TechnoTypes,
  alternative lists, negative prerequisites, stolen-tech gates, and theater
  gates when map theater context is available.

## Compatibility status

This is intentionally not a claim of complete runtime compatibility yet.
The scanner and feature registry are the source of truth for the next phases:

1. scan the target user's local MO INIs and generate a requirement report;
2. implement each required Ares capability as a normalized parser/runtime
   feature;
3. verify each feature with a synthetic fixture and local MO integration test;
4. validate skirmish, save/load, deterministic lockstep, LAN, and campaigns.

Proprietary RA2, Yuri's Revenge, and Mental Omega files are not committed to
this repository or bundled in public APKs. Local integration tests should be
run against user-owned installations.
